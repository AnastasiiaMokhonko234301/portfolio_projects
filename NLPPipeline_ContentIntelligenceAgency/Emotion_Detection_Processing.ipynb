    "Emotion Detection aims to classify a fine-grained emotion for each utterance in multiparty dialogue. Our annotation is based on the primary emotions in the Feeling Wheel (Willcox, 1982). We must admit that the inter-annotator agreement of this annotation is not the greatest; we welcome any contribution from the community to improve the annotation quality. This task is a part of the Character Mining project led by the Emory NLP research group.\n",
