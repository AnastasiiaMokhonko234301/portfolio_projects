## Overview

This project examines the distribution and trends of detected human trafficking victims globally, focusing on regional variations, victim demographics, and types of exploitation to inform prevention and intervention strategies.

### Research Question

*"How did age and sex affect the frequency of human trafficking incidents and type of labour?"*

## Key Findings

**Victim Demographics:**
- Majority of victims fall within 18-29 age range
- 56.9% of victims are female, 43% male
- Females are disproportionately subjected to sexual exploitation

**Regional Patterns:**
- Europe, Africa, and parts of Asia show higher concentrations of detected victims
- Eastern Europe, East Africa, and South America have elevated rates
- Sexual exploitation more prevalent than forced labor in most regions

**Temporal Trends:**
- Positive correlation (0.68) between detected victims and year
- Increasing trend indicates rising detection or incidence over time

## Dashboard Structure

1. **Introduction** - Research context and objectives
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Data selection, cleaning, transformation methodology
3. **Findings** - Interactive visualizations and insights
4. **Discussion** - Interpretation and implications
5. **Conclusion** - Summary and next steps

## Visualizations

- **Geographic Map**: Global distribution of detected trafficking victims
- **Age Distribution**: Histogram showing victim age ranges
- **Gender Analysis**: Pie chart and bar chart of victim gender by year
- **Exploitation Types**: Regional breakdown of forced labor vs. sexual exploitation
- **Trend Analysis**: Time series showing victims detected over years with correlation coefficient

## Data Considerations

- Data represents only "detected" victims; many cases remain undetected
- Cultural, political, and legal differences across countries affect detection rates
- Analysis focuses on reported cases which may underrepresent true scale

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop** - Dashboard creation and data visualization
- **Power Query** - Data cleaning and transformation
- **DAX** - Calculated measures and columns

## Next Steps

- Analyze socioeconomic indicators correlating with trafficking rates
- Investigate causative factors behind regional disparities
- Collaborate with NGOs for qualitative insights
- Deeper analysis of age and gender vulnerability factors
